          For an agent to be genuinely effective, it must comprehend and
          interact with the intricate and ever-changing world as humans
          do—absorbing and retaining visual information to grasp the context and
          respond accordingly. It also needs to be forward-thinking, adaptable,
          and intuitive, ensuring that users can engage with it effortlessly and
          in real-time.
