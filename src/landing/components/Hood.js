          To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the
          complex and dynamic world just like people do â€” and take in and
          remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action.
          It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can
          talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.
